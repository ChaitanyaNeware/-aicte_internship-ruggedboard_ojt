Write brief note about ls using man page.

The most common ls options are -a (all files) and -l (long or details).
Tab completion is supported and can be configured with .inputrc
When output to file the files are listed one per line.

ls is pronounced as the two letters: "ell ess"

By default, colour is not used to distinguish types of files. That is equivalent to using --color=none.
Using the --color option without the optional WHEN argument is equivalent to using --color=always.
With --color=auto, color codes are output only if standard output is connected to a terminal (tty).
